# Portal 2 Mod Speedrun Mods

Different "speedrun mods" for Portal 2 modifications. Speedrun mods include removing any in-game load times, such as cutscenes, elevator wait times, and dialogues. These mods are not intended for casual play, since much of the story is ignored during development of these mods.

See sub-folders for specific mod install instructions, and see [releases page](https://github.com/JaioCG/p2mod-speedrun-utils/releases) for downloads.
