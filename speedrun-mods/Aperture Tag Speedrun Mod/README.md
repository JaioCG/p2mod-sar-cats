# Aperture Tag Speedrun Mod

This is a mod for [Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative](https://store.steampowered.com/app/280740/Aperture_Tag_The_Paint_Gun_Testing_Initiative/) that removes any cutscenes and waiting throughout the levels, with some exceptions, like the final track cutscene.

## Installation

Download the release from the [releases page](https://github.com/JaioCG/p2mod-speedrun-utils/releases), and extract the contents to your Aperture Tag folder, dragging the `aperturetag` folder from the download on top of the already existing one.

In-game, you can start the mod by typing `map sm_gg_intro_wakeup` into console.
