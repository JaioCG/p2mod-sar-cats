# Memories (Transitioned Maps)

Replacement maps for [Portal 2 | Memories](https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-2-memories) that transition the player instead of kicking you out to menu.

## Installation

Download the release from the [releases page](https://github.com/JaioCG/p2mod-speedrun-utils/releases), and extract the contents to your Memories folder, dragging the `maps` folder from the download to the same place as the already existing one.
