# Portal 2 Mod Save Files

Many mods start with a vault/cutscene that a save can skip. See sub-folders for these save files and install them to `[Mod Folder/modfolder]/SAVE/<steam id>/`.

For use with these saves, please edit your `sar_speedrun_offset` values to match the following:

| Mod              | sar_speedrun_offset Value   |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Aperture Ireland | 3600                        |
| Mind Escape      | 2730                        |
| P1 Done P2       | 3412                        |
| Portal Reloaded  | 2394 (built into srconfigs) |
| Welcome Back     | 1180                        |

Any other save files included are either not for the start of a run, or can be used with `sar_speedrun_offset 0`.
